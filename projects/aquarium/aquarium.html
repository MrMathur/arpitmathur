        <h1>THE PROBLEM</h1>
        <p>As part of the Expansion 2020 project, the Georgia Aquarium aims to introduce the Predator exhibit shark
          tank. Contrary to the exhibit's name, the aim of the project is to use technology to educate and flip the
          perception of sharks, from fear to fascination.<br />
          <img src="snapshot1.png" />
        </p>
        <h1>THE SOLUTION</h1>
        <p>We implemented User-Centered Research methods to inform the design for an interactive screen exhibit with a
          mobile-based interface, that caters to multiple family members. The solution educates about the role of sharks
          in the food chain and demystifies myths that make them scary.</p>
        <h1>THE IMPACT</h1>
        <p>The Aquarium will use our research inferences to inform the design decisions of the upcoming Predator
          Exhibit, especially in terms of guest management. They will also incorporate features from our design into
          interactive and educative solutions that are feasible to incorporate.</p>

            To begin, we conducted research with visitors at the aquarium, to understand the shortcomings of the current
            exhibits. The proposed design of the predator project can be seen on the right, and we decided to conduct
            research in current exhibits with similar structures.
            <br /><br />We employed the following research methods in order to gather data:

          <p>To design a positive experience for the Richard family at the aquarium, it was important for us to identify

            the high and low points of the existing visitor experience.</p>

            We needed an evaluation of our ideas to identify characteristics that are desirable. This evaluation needed

            <h2>WHAT<span> did we want to know?</span></h2>
            <p>- Perception of the user regarding the solution<br />
              - Feedback on Usability of the solution<br />
              - Evaluating the enjoyment of the experience</p>
            <h2>WHY <span>this method?</span></h2>
            <p>- Rich qualitative data in the form of follow up questions<br />
              - Ability to observe interctions of users</p>
            <h2>HOW<span> did we do it?</span></h2>
            <p>- We recruited 8 participants, and had two sessions with 4 participants each<br />
              - We had the participants play different roles of family members, and had them interact with our
              solution through the Wizard of Oz technique<br />
              - We interviewed the participants about their likes and dislikes<br />

          solution required more thought. These are shown as follows: </p>

          <p>Visitors might not be willing to scan QR codes without knowing what is in store for them. They cannot
            expect what are the outcomes of scanning QR codes, so they are apprehensive of doing so. It will be better
            to get a preview of what comes next after scanning QR codes. </p>

          <p>Some users did not understand what NFC scanning is and how it works. There is too much technical jargon
            used that may make users uneasy. We can replace jargon with friendly language that everyone understands and
            make it accessible to users with varying levels of technical skills.</p>

          <p>The message behind the dead and barren ocean in the absence of sharks was misunderstood by most people. We
            can animate the interactive screen to visualize the percentage of sharks in the ocean, developing a stronger
            correlation between the ocean and the population of sharks.</p>

          <h1>Lessons Learned</h1><br />
          <h2>Working with industry partners</h2>
          <p>
            I learned that it is important to keep the stakeholders in the loop, and their goals can be in unison with
            the users'.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Involving users in iterative design</h2>
          <p>
            I learned the value of taking feedback for every iteration of the solution, and how it helps the designer
            look
            beyond their biases.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Context is important</h2>
          <p>
            Richer data can be gathered on the field, as compared to recreating the setting artificially in a lab.
            Moreover, the fidelity of the design effects the quality of feedback.
