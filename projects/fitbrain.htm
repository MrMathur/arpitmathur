                <h3>What is Alzheimer’s Disease?</h3>
                <p>Alzheimer’s is a type of dementia that causes problems with memory, thinking and behaviour.
                    Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse over time, becoming severe enough to interfere with daily tasks.</p>

                <p>Alzheimer is one of the most prevalent problems of the current society.</p>

                <p>Currently, One in nine people at age 60+ and nearly one-third of people aged 85 and older have Alzheimer’s. However, in the future, Alzheimer is predicted to be present in 2 of 5 people.</p>

                <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
                <h3>What's the science behind the disease?</h3>
                <p>Normal brain functions by communication of electric signals, much like our everyday circuits. Information is transmitted in the form of chemicals, between biological cells called NEURONS. These chemicals are transported between parts of the Neuron called SYNAPSES, and a by product called amyloid beta is released as a part of the process.</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
                    <div class="col-lg-6">
                        <img src="./images/Project-Images/FITBrain/5.png" />
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
                </div>
                <p>The by-product is metabolized by a chemical called MICROGLIA, in the presence of oxygen. However, sometimes,  if Amyloid Beta is not metabolized due to excess formation, or due to shortage of Microglia, the by-product accumulates to form protein clusters known as “Plaques” and “Tangles”. These plaques and tangles obstruct the space between the synapses, and prevent information transfer, leading to loss in memory and functionality. This is the early stage of the disease.</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
                    <div class="col-lg-6">
                        <img src="./images/Project-Images/FITBrain/6.png" />
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
                </div>
                <p>Once the accumulation of proteins reaches a certain tipping point, it sends the housekeeping Microglia molecule into overdrive. The body starts synthesizing excess of these molecules, so much so that they start decomposing the synapses, causing brain damage. This is the latter stage of Alzheimer, and leads to death.</p>

                <p>NEUROPLASTICITY refers to the brain’s ability to generate new synapses. If a lot of synapses are generated by the brain, the impact of amyloid beta accumulation is significantly reduced. This is because the information finds alternate ways to travel, even if the older paths of synapses have been destroyed. This is possible only when there is an abundancy of synapses in the brain.</p>
                <p>Neuroplasticity is facilitated by human habits. Particularly, humans that are always engaging their brains in learning something new, are less prone to Alzheimer’s disease, thanks to Neuroplasticity. Learning new languages, getting an education, learning a new physical skill, all these activities facilitate the brain in generating new synapses, and protecting the brain against Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

                <h3>How can Instructional Design help?</h3>
                <p>From the research it was clear that there are only two ways to prevent a person developing Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
                <p> The first way involves incorporating yoga into one’s daily routine, in order to prevent amyloid beta accumulation.</p>
                <p> The second way involves engaging the brain in learning new things in order to generate new synapses through Neuroplasticity, rendering amyloid beta accumulation harmless.</p>

                <p>We decided to use the ADDIE model of instructional design. This model will ensure that the instructions designed are relevant to the target user. As part of the model, we had to go through the following five stages iteratively, not sequentially.</p>

                <h3>What exactly do we have to teach?</h3>
                <p>For our problem statement, we want to teach people relevant Yoga exercises that help in preventing Alzheimers disease. For the purposes of this project, we decided to conduct an instructional analysis of one of the yoga practices suggested to us by the Yoga instructor. With their help, we were able to break down the individual steps involved in doing a Padahastasana.</p>
