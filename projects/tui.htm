        <p class="detail-info">
          As part of the course titled “Tangible User Interfaces”, my group and I had to develop a prototpye tackling
          the problems faced by children afflicted with Cerebral Palsy.<br /><br />
          We designed ProximiTREE, a tangible device that teaches the CP patients the skill of subitization. As part of
          the project, we had to gain insights through a user study, convert them into a design solution, and develop a
          prototype.
          <br /><br />
          I conducted this project along with my colleagues <a href="https://ashutoshdesign.github.io/">Ashutosh

          The Gestalt law of proximity states that "objects or shapes that are
          close to one another appear to form groups". Tangible technologies have generated a wealth of novel
          opportunities to support children’s learning. Digital effects might be used to encourage certain actions and
          states over others, thereby allowing a balance to made between
          efficiency and innovation. Thus, tangible interfaces can be
          effective in supporting children’s learning.

      <p class="col-lg-8" id="user-research">Considerably less research has been done towards developing
        gestalt perception of proximity in children as its an innate
        psychological ability but is impaired in CP children. Initial
        ideation sessions were directed towards identifying real-life
        scenarios involving application of the proximity principle.
        Another strategy used was to ideate upon the various ways in
        which this ability could be tested in another person. Instructions
        for learning can be then be derived from the test. After narrowing
        down to a specific scenario, principles and characteristics of TUI
        were applied to develop the concept.</p>

    <h2 class="col-lg-12 second-header">4. CONCEPT</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-2"></div>
      <p class="col-lg-8" id="user-research">Efforts were put in to combine real-life metaphors to the learning
        process while keeping it entertaining and engaging. Games have
        shown to assist learning in children. They are fun, engaging and
        make learning enjoyable for children. Various real-life scenarios
        were explored that can be implemented in the game. Finally, the
        scenario of “helping a farmer pluck fruits from a tree” was
        chosen.<br /><br />
        The final concept involves an interactive game, with a screen-less
        interface that shall also try to improve the motor skills of the
        children. The interface consists of a vertical interactive surface in
        the form of a tree with fruits hanging on it in different clusters.
        The fruits hang in a cluster at different orientation and angles in a
        non-canonical arrangement such that the relative distance between
        them is less. Each cluster is enclosed by LED lights. There’s a
        basket below the tree to collect the fruits. The final goal of the
        game is to help the farmer to collect all fruits from a particular
        cluster in the basket thereby learning the concept of grouping
        together objects close to each other. By volunteering to help out
        the farmer, the child also learns a sense of responsibility towards
        other human beings thereby improving their social skills in the
        process. <br /><br />
        The child initially picks a cluster of fruits of his choice by
        plucking a fruit from that cluster. The light around that cluster
        flashes for a short interval to indicate the chosen cluster. The child
        is then required to pluck all the fruits from that particular cluster
        and place them on the basket. If he tries to plucks a fruit from a
        different cluster, the mechanism doesn’t enable him to do so and
        the light from the chosen cluster flashes in regular intervals. If
        there is an inactivity of 30 seconds from the child, the light from
        the chosen cluster again flashes to highlight that cluster. Upon
        collecting all the fruits, the farmer is happy and thanks for the
        child for his help.</p>

        The arduino is attached to the tree, and connected to a laptop via a nrf module for data transfer. The arduino
        senses the presense or absence of a ball from its position through light sensors. The values were caliberated
        through trial and error by placing and replacing the balls multiple times from the tree.<br /><br />
        The LEDs were attached by surrounding each of the clusters of the balls to demonstrate the solution (ideally,
        the balls should light up on their own). According to the logic of the solution (as in the flow above), the
        LEDs would light up using the response from the Arduino.<br /><br />
        When all the clusters have been removed from the tree, the arduino device sends a signal to the laptop to start
        the video of a farmer waving and thanking the child for collecting his fruit.
