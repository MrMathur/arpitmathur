            <b>Quantum Physics</b> is an interesting field of study, and crucial to the understanding of many modern
            devices
            and engineering concepts. In many ways, it is counter-intuitive, and <b>relies on mathematical equations of
              energy</b> to explain observed phenomena, as opposed to the more physical and visible nature of Newtonian
            Physics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The concepts, as a result of this heavy reliance on complex mathematical formulae, are very abstract, and
            <b>extremely hard to visualize</b>. Visualisation is a powerful concept that facilitates learning
            significantly.
            Many students who are visual learners, as a result face <b>difficulty in grasping these concepts</b>.

            This observation is echoed in the CIOS evaluations of students taking the course EC 3040 Semiconductor
            Devices at Georgia Tech. The course attempts to provide instruction for a lot of these concepts, but
            students often struggle to visualize them.

            I have worked for a period of a year as a designer and developer to create visualizations that professors
            can use in this course as course material. I have intended for this project to be a useful tool for students
            and instructors alike. In this case study, I will share all I’ve learned about design as a result of these
            efforts.

            You cannot design technology to educate others, without having a solid grasp of the content yourself. The
            initial phase of the project was all about learning the concepts that we wanted to instruct the students.
            While spending some time on educating ourselves initially helped us get started, learning the concepts as we
            went along has been one of the core activities of this project.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was fortunate that I had a basis for these concepts due to my first year education at IITG including
            engineering
            subjects.

            I was fortunate enough to have some very good resources at my disposal to learn these concepts. A few of the
            resources I've utilized continuously have been:

          <br />
          <h2>Quantum<br /> Text Books</h2>
          <p>
            The textbooks were useful in not just communicating the concepts, but also in putting me in the shoes of the
            students. Employing a user centered approach, I was able to empathize with them on the difficulties of
            grasphing the subject.

          <h2>3Blue1Brown<br /> Videos</h2>
          <p>
            3Blue1Brown videos were useful in develop an understanding. It is a
            channel that creates visualizations for the most fundamental concepts
            of quantum physics. However, I struggled to find their application in Semiconductor devices context.

          <h2>Explorable<br /> Explanations</h2>
          <p>
            I also strengthened my understanding in the form of interactive websites on certain topics. These were
            especially engaging, and successful at making the learning joyful. However, they required investment of a
            lot of time on very specific topics.

          <h2>Attending<br /> Classes</h2>
          <p>
            The best resource I had was the instruction of Prof. Azad Naeemi from GaTech's ECE department. He was not
            only helpful in terms of helping clear doubts and misconceptions, but I was also able to bounce off ideas
            and get feedback.

            The activity of studying the content helped achieve three goals:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><span>I got a <b>strong grasp of the concepts</b>. This would in turn help make me design decisions for
                a
                product that could communicate these concepts to a large audience.</span></li>
            <li><span>I developed some <b>empathy for the students</b>. Learning from scratch helped me understand the
                intimidation and setbacks students face. I could also identified areas of opportunities to focus
                on.</span></li>
            <li><span>I was also able to get well-versed with <b>existing solutions</b> that are available to students.
                This
                helped verify the need for a tailor made solution for our students. It also gave inspiration for
                directions we could pursue.</span></li>

            With a blank canvas, we set out to decide what would be the best mechanism for the delivery of this
            instruction. We had the following two goals to assess the suitability of different media.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><span><b>Easy to deliver in class:</b> Professors of EC 3040 should be able to interact with the
                solution in a class and give their instruction to students simultaneously.
              </span></li>
            <li><span><b>Self Sufficient:</b> Students should be able to derive meaning from the solution on their own,
                without
                instruction. In other words, students outside of the course should also be able to learn from the
                solution.</span></li>

          <p><img src="./images/quant/1emoji.svg" style="width: 16px; margin-right: 4px;" />
            It's difficult for Professors to speak over the sound of the video. Moreover, they often have to pause to
            certain frames to point and explain the concept.
          </p>
          <p><img src="./images/quant/2emoji.svg" style="width: 16px; margin-right: 4px;" />
            Videos are a good and immersive medium for students to individually engage with and learn the concepts.
            Moreover, they can watch it at their pace.

          <p><img src="./images/quant/1emoji.svg" style="width: 16px; margin-right: 4px;" />
            The Professor can often get distracted due to the cognitive demands of a game. It is also more difficult for
            a student to remain engaged.
          </p>
          <p><img src="./images/quant/2emoji.svg" style="width: 16px; margin-right: 4px;" />
            Games are very engaging and immersive. They can effectively convey a narrative. But it does not account for
            students needing to revist concepts non-linearly.

            Similar to academic papers, so Professors are well versed with presentation to an audience. Cognitive load
            is avoided due to the simple interaction.
          </p>
          <p><img src="./images/quant/2emoji.svg" style="width: 16px; margin-right: 4px;" />
            Allow the students to study at their pace, and are suitably immersive. The accompanying descriptions

            We identified the two types of views we would need as follows:

            <li><span><b>Abstract Space: </b>these visualizations are concepts such as energy, effective mass, etc.

            The decision in structure was a big step towards consistency. This meant that even though different chapters
            would consist of different visualizations and a variety of topics, they would all look like they belong to
            the same set. Another piece to the puzzle of consistency was to establish the style guide.

            In terms of the style, we decided on a minimal, clean, and modern look. In the same spirit we decided to
            forego blurring and shadow effects, instead focusing on solid colors.

            The biggest concern in terms of the color palette was to ensure that the final solutions were accessible to
            all students. To cater to the modern and minimal look, we went for a dark themed website. Once we had
            decided on the hues for the major recurring elements across visualizations, we adhered to the WCAG 2.0
            guidelines by tweaking the colors.

            At this point, it was time to start sketching ideas for individual visualizations. We did a lot of sketching
            to get ideas across and have discussions on them. We would also get feedback from Prof. Azad, to ensure the
            designs were consistent with the scientific facts.

            To help us realise how these concepts will look digitally, we would first create a mockup of the whole
            chapter using our Figma style guide.. This not only enabled us to get a higher-fidelity prototype for the
            visualizations, but it was also a helpful way of <b>tying individual visualizations into a narrative</b>.

            Figma helped us achieve the look and feel, the narrative, as well as a limited amount of functionality.
            However, <b>the nature of interaction we were proposing in our solutions could not be prototyped using
              Figma</b>.
            At this stage, having determined the direction to pursue, we developed the interactive chapter using
            HTML/CSS and p5.js.
          </p>
          <p>
            The prototype in code gave us the best understanding of the concept, and we would often understand what
            works and doesn’t after interacting with this version. We repeated this methodology for every chapter we
            created.

            The intuitiveness of our visualizations was a priority, as the project was also going to be used by students
            in isolation. To ensure we make all possible interactions crystal clear, we relied heavily on different
            types of micro-interactions. Some of the micro-interactions we utilized are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><span><b>Help Text on Scroll: </b>
                If a new interaction becomes available on scroll, help text appears on the screen to guide the user.
              </span></li>
            <li><span><b>Label and Opacity on Hover: </b>
                Hovering on certain elements, such as an electron, help you give more information about the element. The
                opacity also changes to indicate the interaction.</span></li>
            <li><span><b>Cursor change: </b>
                The cursor icon depicts which visualizations require interaction, and which ones don't.</span></li>
            <li><span><b>Transition Animation: </b>
                Motion has been linearly interpolated where ever necessary to maintain continuity.</span></li>
